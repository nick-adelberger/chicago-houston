    "Chicago, on Lake Michigan in Illinois, is the 3rd largest city in the United States and is home to more than 2.7 million people. Known as \"The Windy City\", Chicago is an international hub for finance, culture, commerce, industry, education, technology, telecommunications, and transportation (reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago). Houston, popularly known as \"The Bayou City\", is set to become the 4th largest city in the United States by the second half of 2020. Houston's economy has a broad industrial base in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. It has become a global city, with strengths in culture, medicine and research (reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a current resident of Chicago, I have been offered a job in Houston as a Data Anaylist. Before accepting the position, I would like to discover more insight into the city of Houston to find any similarities or dissimilarities to Chicago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are a lot of neighborhoods within both cities, I will first try to detect the **distinct venues** that make up the **North Side of Chicago** since I currently live within that area. I will then break down the City of Houston into similar areas to compare and contrast so that I can **find the area of Houston that is similar to where I live in Chicago.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use my data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on the above criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by anyone who is considering moving to Houston."

    "This concludes our analysis. We have found 43 different Neighborhoods located throughout Houston that have similar venues to Chicago. By using the Top 10 venues we can assume at the very least that these neighborhoods will have a similar feel as for the types of venues within. That being said, every neighborhood has a different feel that can not be known by just venue type alone. Also, our list is rather large and I would consider breaking down to searching by radius of areas containing multiple neighborhoods to hopefully get better clustering results. What's interesting is that majority of the Houston clusters are located within the Inner Loop (Orange dots). While Houston is the 4th largest city behind Chicago, Houston population density may be spread out further while Chicago's density is much more centrally located. "

    "Our analysis shows that there are many neighborhoods in the Houston area (43 neighborhoods in total) that are similar to Chicago. Since we lived on the North Side of Chicago, we focused out attention to finding the venues that made up those neighborhoods. There are hundreds of venues located around each Neighborhood which would have made our Data large and messy for analysis. Therefore, by taking the Top 10 venues, we were able to analyize and compair the data across multiple neighborhoods.\n",

    "Since we were looking to find any neighborhoods in Houston that were similar, we got the Top 10 venues for every neighborhood in Houston. This way, we were able to combine the results and run our cluster model to fit the neighborhoods in Houston to those in Chicago. To figure out the optimal amount of clusters, we ran an Elbow Method test and got a result of 9 clusters. \n",

    "We got our list of Neighborhoods similar to Chicago where we could further examine and determine which neighborhood/s would be the best fit. This, of course does not imply that those neighborhoods are the best fit for us. While they may have similar venues, neighborhoods are also definied by their culture and the residents living within. You will find all types of venues in every neighborhood, and even though these neighborhoods contained similar venues, I would suggest doing furthur analysis into each of them before commiting to move there. While we created a recommended list of Neighborhoods, these neighborhoods give us a great starting point where one can start looking into other attributes such as average age of the population, cost of living, crime data and other demographics.

    "Purpose of this project was to identify the neighborhoods in Houston that were similar to the neighborhoods on the north side of Chicago to help myself determine if I should accept a job and move to Houston. By determining the Top 10 venues within each neighborhood by using the Foursquare data, I was able to identify the the neighborhoods in Houston that were similar to Chicago by using k-means clustering. The list of neighborhoods generated can be used as starting points for final anaylsis to determine where I should move.\n",
